## What measurements to take after/during recordings

* Lots of photos (As many as possible, with time-stamps printed on them is even better)
* Lots of videos (of the array, the birds, etc.)
* Laser-range finder measurements from key landmark points to the edge of each 4-mic unit. The 'top' level and the 'base' too. 
* Attach a speaker to the pole and move it along the mouth of the cave, and also place it on key landmark points - use one of the two playback files attached (```linearsweep_10ms_44100Hzsamplerate_15000.0_to_200Hz.wav``` or ```linearsweep_10ms_48000Hzsamplerate_15000.0_to_200Hz.wav```)
